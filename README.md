Directional Regularity for Multivariate Functional Data

```direg``` is a `R` package for estimating the directional regularity of multivariate functional data. It allows one to estimate the change-of-basis matrix
to take advantage of the intrinsic anisotropy of a process. Additional features include simulating anisotropic fractional brownian motions (fBms), surface smoothing
and anisotropic detection. Currently implementated for bi-variate processes.
